# GitHub Repository Readme

This repository contains earthquake data analysis scripts and queries. 
The dataset includes information about earthquakes, such as magnitude, location, cause, and occurrence date.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the earthquake dataset. It includes the following columns: `magnitude`, `place`, `cause`, and `occurred_on`. The `earthquake` table represents the earthquake data.

## Data Exploration

The repository provides SQL queries to explore the earthquake dataset. Here are some of the analysis queries included:

- Determining the magnitude range covered by the earthquake data.
- Identifying places with high-magnitude earthquakes.
- Counting the number of natural and non-natural earthquakes.
- Listing places where nuclear explosions occurred.
- Identifying the most recent earthquake caused by a nuclear explosion.
- Finding the 10 largest earthquakes between 1969 and 2017.

Feel free to use these queries to gain insights from the earthquake dataset.

## How to Use

To use this repository, clone or download the files and execute the provided SQL queries on your database management system.
 Make sure to update the queries or modify the table/column names to match your specific dataset schema.

Please note that this repository does not provide the dataset itself. You will need to obtain the earthquake dataset separately to execute the queries successfully.
